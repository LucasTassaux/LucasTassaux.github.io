I will graduate from l’École Polytechnique de Montréal this December. I’m really excited to finally become a software engineer! When I read the job description, I knew that I had to apply for this job. As I’m looking for a position in which I would learn a lot of precious skills while surrounded by passionate colleagues. And Jonar seems to satisfy both these requirements. \n\nAs said before I’m graduating from a bachelor’s degree in software engineering during which I had lots of opportunities to learn all the essential knowledge of a good software engineer such as software architecture and software quality. I worked using JavaScript and Node.js during multiple school projects and professional experiences. I had the chance to work on multiple group projects which helped me learn how to work and communicate efficiently inside of a team. As you can see in my resume, I worked on a lot of different parts of software development, such as Frontend, Backend, NLP, data management and integrated systems. I think these diverse experiences helped me become a more autonomous worker and a fast learner. I am passionate about software development and problem solving. I love learning new skills and using them to create mini projects like this cover letter. I would love to fuel my passion by working for Jonar.\n\nWorking on developing and maintaining a great ERP system such as ParagonERP would be a great experience for me as it is a complete software impacting the lives of a lot of people. Also, Jonar seems to have an exciting and fulfilling workplace which is something I value a lot in a company. \n\n\nThank you for your consideration, I’m looking forward to meeting you and learning more about Jonar.\n\nSincerely, \n\nLucas Tassaux";
